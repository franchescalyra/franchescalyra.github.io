      <description>Franchesca Maria Lyra Introduction: The dataset was acquired from country health rankings (https://www.countyhealthrankings.org/app/texas/2021/measure/factors/9/map), it is Texas summary data from 2018 that contains percentages of health concerns, economic statuses, and education status of residents in each Texas county. To keep the data tidy and shorter, I deleted columns that were not of concern/interest. The main data set I gathered from was split and then rejoined, as the data set had several tabs in original excel.</description>
